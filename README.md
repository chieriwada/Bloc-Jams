# About Bloc
[Bloc](https://bloc.io) is a UX design bootcamp and apprenticeship where students can deepen their understanding of the UX design process. During my time with Bloc, I studied the entire UX cycle - from ideation, research, visual design to frontend development - while being mentored by a senior industry professional.
